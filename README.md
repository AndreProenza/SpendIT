# SpendIT
Automatic finance manager with analytical AI


## Goals

Design an innovative digital service provided by a public administration organism to the community by applying design methods, techniques, and tools. Artifacts of design such as problem and solution frameworks, empathy and affinity maps, service models, storyboards, wireframes, and project canvas are developed. 

The goal of SpendIT is to analyze and design, not actually to implement a solution.
