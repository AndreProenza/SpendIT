# SpendIT
Automatic finance manager with analytical AI


## Introduction

SpendIT is an idea for an innovative digital service which can be provided by a public administration organism to the community, through the application of design methods, techniques and tools. SpendIT is composed by design artifacts such as problem and solution frameworks, empathy and affinity maps, service models, storyboards, wireframes, and a project canvas. 

SpendIT's main purpose is not actually to implement a solution, but rather to analyze and design an innovative idea.
